Music Source Policy: This application does not support YouTube links or any functionality that downloads or converts audio from YouTube, as this is not permitted by YouTube’s Terms of Service, even for non-copyrighted content. Users should only use music files they own or audio downloaded from legal sources that explicitly allow downloading and conversion. For royalty-free and permission-based music, we recommend using Free Music Archive. Users are responsible for ensuring that their music usage complies with the applicable license terms.
